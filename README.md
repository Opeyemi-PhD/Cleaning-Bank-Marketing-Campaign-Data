## Project Overview
Personal loans are a lucrative revenue stream for banks. The typical interest rate of a two-year loan in the United Kingdom is [around 10%](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/whats-a-good-interest-rate-for-a-personal-loan/). This might not sound like a lot, but in September 2022 alone UK consumers borrowed [around £1.5 billion](https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-12/Household%20Finance%20Review%202022%20Q3-%20Final.pdf), which would mean approximately £300 million in interest generated by banks over two years!

In this project, I worked with data collected by a bank as part of a recent marketing campaign aimed at encouraging customers to take out personal loans. Since the bank plans to conduct additional marketing campaigns in the future, the goal was to ensure that the data conforms to a specific structure and data types. This will allow the cleaned data to be stored in a PostgreSQL database, making it easier to import and analyze data from future campaigns.

The dataset provided was a CSV file named "bank_marketing.csv", which I cleaned, reformatted, and split into three final CSV files. The files and their specifications are outlined below.

## `client.csv`

| column | data type | description | cleaning requirements |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| `client_id` | `integer` | Client ID | N/A |
| `age` | `integer` | Client's age in years | N/A |
| `job` | `object` | Client's type of job | Change `"."` to `"_"` |
| `marital` | `object` | Client's marital status | N/A |
| `education` | `object` | Client's level of education | Change `"."` to `"_"` and `"unknown"` to `np.NaN` |
| `credit_default` | `bool` | Whether the client's credit is in default | Convert to `boolean` data type:<br> `1` if `"yes"`, otherwise `0` |
| `mortgage` | `bool` | Whether the client has an existing mortgage (housing loan) | Convert to boolean data type:<br> `1` if `"yes"`, otherwise `0` |

<br>

## `campaign.csv`

| column | data type | description | cleaning requirements |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| `client_id` | `integer` | Client ID | N/A |
| `number_contacts` | `integer` | Number of contact attempts to the client in the current campaign | N/A |
| `contact_duration` | `integer` | Last contact duration in seconds | N/A |
| `previous_campaign_contacts` | `integer` | Number of contact attempts to the client in the previous campaign | N/A |
| `previous_outcome` | `bool` | Outcome of the previous campaign | Convert to boolean data type:<br> `1` if `"success"`, otherwise `0`. |
| `campaign_outcome` | `bool` | Outcome of the current campaign | Convert to boolean data type:<br> `1` if `"yes"`, otherwise `0`. |
| `last_contact_date` | `datetime` | Last date the client was contacted | Create from a combination of `day`, `month`, and a newly created `year` column (which should have a value of `2022`); <br> **Format =** `"YYYY-MM-DD"` |

<br>

## `economics.csv`

| column | data type | description | cleaning requirements |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| `client_id` | `integer` | Client ID | N/A |
| `cons_price_idx` | `float` | Consumer price index (monthly indicator) | N/A |
| `euribor_three_months` | `float` | Euro Interbank Offered Rate (euribor) three-month rate (daily indicator) | N/A |

## Dataset Description
The dataset bank_marketing.csv contains about 41,000 entries and 16 columns, representing information collected from a bank’s marketing campaign.
It includes demographic data about clients, details of previous and current marketing campaigns, and relevant economic indicators.

## Steps Summary
1. Imported Required Libraries
-  Used **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation and cleaning.
  
2. Loaded and Inspected the Dataset
-  Loaded the dataset using `pd.read_csv("bank_marketing.csv")`.
-  Displayed the first and last five rows with `head()` and `tail()`.
-  Obtained a brief summary of the dataset using the `info()`.

3. Cleaned and Formatted Categorical Columns
-  Replaced "." with "_" in job and education columns.
-  Replaced "unknown" in education with `np.nan`.
  
4. Converted Object Columns to Boolean Data Types
- Transformed the following columns to boolean according to project requirements:
  - credit_default
  - mortgage 
  - previous_outcome
  - campaign_outcome

5. Created and Formatted Date Columns
- Converted day and month columns to strings.
- Created a new column year with a constant value of "2022".
- Combined these into a new column last_contact_date formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD".

6. Created Subsets of the DataFrame **bank_marketing**
- **client_df** with columns: client_id, age, job, marital, education, credit_default, mortgage.
- **economics_df** with columns: client_id, cons_price_idx, euribor_three_months.
- **campaign_df** with columns: client_id, number_contacts, contact_duration, previous_campaign_contacts, previous_outcome, campaign_outcome, last_contact_date.

7. Displayed DataFrame Samples
- Stored all DataFrames in a list New_DataFrames.
- Used a `for` loop to print the first five rows of each.

8. Exported Cleaned Datasets
- Saved the DataFrames as separate CSV files without indices:
  - **client.csv**
  - **economics.csv**
  - **campaign.csv**

## Conclusions
### All data cleaning, transformation, and formatting steps were successfully completed.  
- The resulting CSV files are now standardized and ready for storage in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring future marketing campaign data can be easily imported and analyzed.
