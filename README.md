# Cleaning-Bank-Marketing-Campaign-Data
Personal loans are a lucrative revenue stream for banks. The typical interest rate of a two-year loan in the United Kingdom is [around 10%](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/whats-a-good-interest-rate-for-a-personal-loan/). This might not sound like a lot, but in September 2022 alone UK consumers borrowed [around £1.5 billion](https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/system/files/2022-12/Household%20Finance%20Review%202022%20Q3-%20Final.pdf), which would mean approximately £300 million in interest generated by banks over two years!

In this project, I worked with data collected by a bank as part of a recent marketing campaign aimed at encouraging customers to take out personal loans. Since the bank plans to conduct additional marketing campaigns in the future, the goal was to ensure that the data conforms to a specific structure and data types. This will allow the cleaned data to be stored in a PostgreSQL database, making it easier to import and analyze data from future campaigns.

The dataset provided was a CSV file named "bank_marketing.csv", which I cleaned, reformatted, and split into three final CSV files. The files and their specifications are outlined below.

## `client.csv`

| column | data type | description | cleaning requirements |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| `client_id` | `integer` | Client ID | N/A |
| `age` | `integer` | Client's age in years | N/A |
| `job` | `object` | Client's type of job | Change `"."` to `"_"` |
| `marital` | `object` | Client's marital status | N/A |
| `education` | `object` | Client's level of education | Change `"."` to `"_"` and `"unknown"` to `np.NaN` |
| `credit_default` | `bool` | Whether the client's credit is in default | Convert to `boolean` data type:<br> `1` if `"yes"`, otherwise `0` |
| `mortgage` | `bool` | Whether the client has an existing mortgage (housing loan) | Convert to boolean data type:<br> `1` if `"yes"`, otherwise `0` |

## `campaign.csv`

| column | data type | description | cleaning requirements |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| `client_id` | `integer` | Client ID | N/A |
| `number_contacts` | `integer` | Number of contact attempts to the client in the current campaign | N/A |
| `contact_duration` | `integer` | Last contact duration in seconds | N/A |
| `previous_campaign_contacts` | `integer` | Number of contact attempts to the client in the previous campaign | N/A |
| `previous_outcome` | `bool` | Outcome of the previous campaign | Convert to boolean data type:<br> `1` if `"success"`, otherwise `0`. |
| `campaign_outcome` | `bool` | Outcome of the current campaign | Convert to boolean data type:<br> `1` if `"yes"`, otherwise `0`. |
| `last_contact_date` | `datetime` | Last date the client was contacted | Create from a combination of `day`, `month`, and a newly created `year` column (which should have a value of `2022`); <br> **Format =** `"YYYY-MM-DD"` |
